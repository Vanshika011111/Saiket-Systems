The project's goal is to analyze customer churn and develop predictive models to identify customers at risk of leaving, ultimately providing actionable insights and recommendations for improving customer retention.
# 📈 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction Dashboard

This repository holds the project files for the Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction task completed during the SaiKet Systems Power BI Internship program.

The core challenge for any telecom company is preventing customer turnover, or **churn**. This project focuses on building an insightful Power BI dashboard to analyze *who* is leaving, *why* they're leaving, and ultimately, to help the business identify and retain at-risk customers.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary objective was to move beyond just knowing the overall churn number. We aimed to develop a dashboard that provides **actionable insights** and **recommendations** by:

1.  Analyzing the current churn rate and identifying high-impact factors (e.g., contract type, tenure, services).
2.  Creating a foundational visual analysis layer that could eventually support a predictive model to flag customers before they leave.

## 🛠️ The Power BI Solution

The dashboard was built through a multi-step process, ensuring the data was clean and the visuals were impactful:

### 1. Data Connection & Transformation
* The raw customer churn dataset was imported into Power BI.
* The Power Query Editor was used for **data cleaning and transformation** (e.g., handling missing values, standardizing columns) to ensure the data was suitable for accurate visualization.

### 2. Dashboard Components (Key Analyses)

The resulting dashboard includes several key sections to guide business decisions:

* [cite_start]**Overall Churn Rate:** A prominent card visualization displaying the percentage of customers who have churned[cite: 60].
* [cite_start]**Customer Demographics Analysis:** Visuals (e.g., Bar Charts, Pie Charts) showing churn distribution across key demographic factors like **gender, partner status, and dependent status**[cite: 65].
* **Tenure Deep Dive:** Histograms and Box Plots illustrating how **customer tenure (in months)** relates to churn. [cite_start]This often reveals if customers leave early on or after their initial contract[cite: 73].
* **Churn Factor Analysis:** Detailed visuals (Stacked Bar Charts, Heatmaps) breaking down churn based on critical service factors:
    * Contract Type (Month-to-month contracts are often a major culprit!)
    * Payment Method
    * [cite_start]Internet Service Type [cite: 76]

## 📦 Repository Structure

* `Churn Analysis Dashboard.pbix`: The final Power BI Desktop file containing the data model and visualizations.
* `Raw Data/`: (Placeholder) Folder for the initial customer churn dataset.
* `Documentation/`: (Placeholder) Folder for any supplementary notes or insights derived from the analysis.

## ✅ Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases proficiency in core Data Analytics and Power BI skills:

* [cite_start]Data importing and connecting various sources[cite: 45].
* [cite_start]Advanced data cleaning and preprocessing techniques[cite: 52, 55].
* DAX formula creation (for key metrics like Churn Rate).
* [cite_start]Creating a variety of compelling visualizations, from simple bar/pie charts to complex heatmaps, to tell a clear data story[cite: 67, 75, 76].
